Feature: Comdirect API Client Library
  As a developer
  I want to use a Python library to interact with the Comdirect API
  So that I can authenticate, manage tokens, and retrieve banking data with proper error handling

  Background:
    Given the Comdirect API base URL is configured
    And client credentials are provided
    And user credentials are provided
    And logging is configured with appropriate log levels

  # ============================================================================
  # Authentication Flow
  # ============================================================================

  Scenario: User triggers initial authentication successfully
    Given the user has valid Comdirect credentials
    When the user triggers authentication
    Then the library should generate a session UUID
    And the library should obtain an OAuth2 password credentials token
    And the library should log "INFO: Starting authentication flow"
    And the library should retrieve the session status
    And the library should log "INFO: Session UUID retrieved"
    And the library should create a TAN challenge
    And the library should log "INFO: TAN challenge created" with TAN type
    And the library should poll for TAN approval every 1 second
    And the library should log "DEBUG: Polling TAN status" for each poll attempt
    And the library should activate the session after TAN approval
    And the library should log "INFO: TAN approved, activating session"
    And the library should exchange for secondary token
    And the library should log "INFO: Authentication successful"
    And the library should store the access token
    And the library should store the refresh token
    And the library should store the token expiry timestamp
    And the authentication should be marked as complete

  Scenario: OAuth2 password credentials grant fails with invalid credentials
    Given the user has invalid Comdirect credentials
    When the user triggers authentication
    Then the library should attempt OAuth2 password credentials grant
    And the library should receive a 401 Unauthorized response
    And the library should log "ERROR: Authentication failed - Invalid credentials"
    And the library should raise an AuthenticationError exception
    And no tokens should be stored

  Scenario: TAN challenge times out after 60 seconds
    Given the user has valid Comdirect credentials
    And the authentication flow has reached the TAN polling stage
    When 60 seconds elapse without TAN approval
    Then the library should log "WARNING: TAN approval timeout"
    And the library should stop polling
    And the library should raise a TANTimeoutError exception
    And the authentication should be marked as failed

  Scenario: TAN challenge is approved via Push-TAN
    Given the authentication flow has reached the TAN polling stage
    And the TAN type is "P_TAN_PUSH"
    When the user approves the TAN in their smartphone app
    Then the library should detect status "AUTHENTICATED" in polling response
    And the library should log "INFO: TAN approved via P_TAN_PUSH"
    And the library should proceed to session activation

  Scenario: Session activation fails with wrong header format
    Given the authentication flow has reached the session activation stage
    When the library sends a PATCH request with incorrect x-once-authentication-info header
    Then the library should receive a 422 Unprocessable Entity response
    And the library should log "ERROR: Session activation failed - Incorrect header format"
    And the library should raise a SessionActivationError exception

  # ============================================================================
  # Automatic Token Refresh with AsyncIO
  # ============================================================================

  Scenario: Automatic token refresh triggered before expiration
    Given the library has valid banking tokens
    And the token expires in 120 seconds
    And the asyncio token refresh task is running
    When the current time reaches 120 seconds before expiration
    Then the library should automatically attempt token refresh
    And the library should log "INFO: Auto-refreshing token (120s before expiry)"
    And the library should send a refresh token request
    And the library should receive new access and refresh tokens
    And the library should update stored tokens
    And the library should update token expiry timestamp
    And the library should log "INFO: Token refresh successful"
    And the asyncio task should schedule next refresh

  Scenario: Token refresh succeeds with new tokens
    Given the library has valid banking tokens with refresh token
    When the library attempts to refresh tokens
    Then the library should POST to /oauth/token with grant_type=refresh_token
    And the library should log "DEBUG: Refreshing token"
    And the library should receive a 200 OK response
    And the library should extract new access_token from response
    And the library should extract new refresh_token from response
    And the library should extract expires_in from response
    And the library should calculate new expiry timestamp
    And the library should log "INFO: Token refreshed, expires in {expires_in}s"

  Scenario: Token refresh fails and triggers reauth callback
    Given the library has expired or invalid refresh token
    And a reauth callback function is registered
    When the library attempts to refresh tokens
    Then the library should receive a 401 Unauthorized response
    And the library should log "WARNING: Token refresh failed - token expired"
    And the library should invoke the reauth callback
    And the library should log "INFO: Reauth callback invoked"
    And the library should wait for user to trigger authentication
    And all tokens should be cleared

  Scenario: AsyncIO refresh task handles concurrent API requests
    Given the library has valid banking tokens
    And multiple async API requests are in progress
    When the token refresh is triggered automatically
    Then the library should acquire a token refresh lock
    And the library should log "DEBUG: Acquiring token refresh lock"
    And the library should complete the token refresh
    And the library should release the lock
    And the library should log "DEBUG: Token refresh lock released"
    And waiting API requests should retry with new token

  Scenario: Token refresh task restarts after authentication
    Given the user has just completed authentication
    And new tokens with expiry time are stored
    When the authentication completes successfully
    Then the library should start an asyncio token refresh task
    And the library should log "INFO: Token refresh task started"
    And the task should calculate next refresh time
    And the task should schedule refresh for 2 minutes before expiry

  # ============================================================================
  # Account Data Retrieval
  # ============================================================================

  Scenario: Retrieve account balances successfully
    Given the library is authenticated with valid tokens
    When the user requests account balances
    Then the library should check token expiry before request
    And the library should log "DEBUG: Fetching account balances"
    And the library should GET /api/banking/clients/user/v2/accounts/balances
    And the library should include Authorization header with bearer token
    And the library should include x-http-request-info header
    And the library should receive a 200 OK response
    And the library should parse the response into AccountBalance typed objects
    And the library should log "INFO: Retrieved {count} account balances"
    And the library should return a list of AccountBalance objects

  Scenario: Account balances request fails with expired token
    Given the library has an expired access token
    And a reauth callback is registered
    When the user requests account balances
    Then the library should GET /api/banking/clients/user/v2/accounts/balances
    And the library should receive a 401 Unauthorized response
    And the library should log "WARNING: API request failed - token expired"
    And the library should attempt automatic token refresh
    And if refresh fails, the library should invoke the reauth callback
    And the library should raise a TokenExpiredError exception

  Scenario: Parse account balance response into typed structures
    Given the library receives a valid account balances response
    When the library parses the response
    Then each account balance should be converted to an AccountBalance object
    And each AccountBalance should have an accountId property of type str
    And each AccountBalance should have an account property of type Account
    And each AccountBalance should have a balance property of type AmountValue
    And each AccountBalance should have a balanceEUR property of type AmountValue
    And each AccountBalance should have an availableCashAmount property of type AmountValue
    And the Account object should have properly typed fields
    And the AmountValue objects should have value as Decimal and unit as str
    And the library should log "DEBUG: Parsed {count} account balance objects"

  # ============================================================================
  # Transaction Retrieval
  # ============================================================================

  Scenario: Retrieve transactions for a specific account
    Given the library is authenticated with valid tokens
    And an account with accountId exists
    When the user requests transactions for the accountId
    Then the library should check token expiry before request
    And the library should log "DEBUG: Fetching transactions for account {accountId}"
    And the library should GET /api/banking/v1/accounts/{accountId}/transactions
    And the library should include Authorization header with bearer token
    And the library should include x-http-request-info header
    And the library should receive a 200 OK response
    And the library should parse the response into Transaction typed objects
    And the library should log "INFO: Retrieved {count} transactions"
    And the library should return a list of Transaction objects

  Scenario: Retrieve transactions with transaction direction filter
    Given the library is authenticated with valid tokens
    And an account with accountId exists
    When the user requests transactions with transactionDirection="DEBIT"
    Then the library should add query parameter "transactionDirection=DEBIT"
    And the library should log "DEBUG: Fetching transactions (direction: DEBIT)"
    And the library should return only debit transactions

  Scenario: Retrieve transactions with pagination
    Given the library is authenticated with valid tokens
    And an account with accountId exists
    When the user requests transactions with paging_first=10
    Then the library should add query parameter "paging-first=10"
    And the library should log "DEBUG: Fetching transactions (starting at: 10)"
    And the library should return transactions starting from index 10

  Scenario: Retrieve transactions with booking status filter
    Given the library is authenticated with valid tokens
    And an account with accountId exists
    When the user requests transactions with transactionState="BOOKED"
    Then the library should add query parameter "transactionState=BOOKED"
    And the library should log "DEBUG: Fetching BOOKED transactions"
    And the library should return only booked transactions

  Scenario: Parse transaction response into typed structures
    Given the library receives a valid transactions response
    When the library parses the response
    Then each transaction should be converted to a Transaction object
    And each Transaction should have a bookingStatus property of type str
    And each Transaction should have a bookingDate property of type Optional[date]
    And each Transaction should have an amount property of type Optional[AmountValue]
    And each Transaction should have optional remitter property of type Optional[AccountInformation]
    And each Transaction should have optional creditor property of type Optional[AccountInformation]
    And each Transaction should have a reference property of type str
    And each Transaction should have a transactionType property of type Optional[EnumText]
    And each Transaction should have a remittanceInfo property of type Optional[str]
    And negative amounts should indicate outgoing transactions
    And positive amounts should indicate incoming transactions
    And the library should log "DEBUG: Parsed {count} transaction objects"

  Scenario: Handle transactions with null optional fields gracefully
    Given the library receives a transactions response with null fields
    And some transactions have null amount
    And some transactions have null transactionType
    And some transactions have null remittanceInfo
    And some transactions have null bookingDate
    And some AccountInformation objects have null iban
    When the library parses the response
    Then the library should not raise an exception
    And Transaction objects should be created with None values for null fields
    And the library should safely handle from_dict() calls on null nested objects
    And the library should log "DEBUG: Parsed {count} transaction objects"

  # ============================================================================
  # Error Handling and Logging
  # ============================================================================

  Scenario: Handle network timeout gracefully
    Given the library is authenticated with valid tokens
    When a network timeout occurs during an API request
    Then the library should log "ERROR: Network timeout during API request"
    And the library should raise a NetworkTimeoutError exception
    And the library should not clear stored tokens

  Scenario: Handle account not found (404)
    Given the library is authenticated with valid tokens
    When the user requests transactions for a non-existent accountId
    Then the library should receive a 404 Not Found response
    And the library should log "ERROR: Account {accountId} not found"
    And the library should raise an AccountNotFoundError exception

  Scenario: Logging levels are appropriate for different events
    Given the library is initialized with logging configured
    Then DEBUG level should be used for detailed flow information
    And INFO level should be used for significant events
    And WARNING level should be used for recoverable errors
    And ERROR level should be used for failures requiring attention
    And sensitive data like tokens and passwords should never be logged
    And token prefixes (first 8 chars) may be logged for debugging

  Scenario: Sanitize sensitive data in logs
    Given the library is performing authentication
    When logging authentication events
    Then passwords should never appear in logs
    And access tokens should never appear in full
    And refresh tokens should never appear in full
    And only non-sensitive identifiers should be logged
    And the library should log "DEBUG: Token received: {token_prefix}..."

  # ============================================================================
  # Reauth Callback Mechanism
  # ============================================================================

  Scenario: Register reauth callback function
    Given the library is initialized
    When the user registers a reauth callback function
    Then the callback should be stored internally
    And the library should log "INFO: Reauth callback registered"
    And the callback should be invoked when reauth is needed

  Scenario: Reauth callback is invoked when refresh fails
    Given a reauth callback is registered
    And the library attempts token refresh
    When the refresh fails with 401 error
    Then the library should invoke the reauth callback
    And the library should log "INFO: Invoking reauth callback"
    And the callback should receive an error reason parameter
    And the library should clear all stored tokens
    And the library should pause the asyncio refresh task

  Scenario: Reauth callback is invoked on persistent 401 errors
    Given a reauth callback is registered
    And the library has tokens stored
    When an API request receives 401 and refresh also fails
    Then the library should invoke the reauth callback with reason="token_refresh_failed"
    And the library should log "ERROR: Persistent authentication failure"
    And the user should be notified to re-authenticate

  Scenario: User triggers authentication after reauth callback
    Given the reauth callback was invoked
    And all tokens were cleared
    When the user triggers authentication again
    Then the library should restart the full authentication flow
    And the library should log "INFO: Re-authentication started"
    And after successful auth, the asyncio refresh task should restart

  # ============================================================================
  # Session Management
  # ============================================================================

  Scenario: Session UUID is generated and reused throughout authentication
    Given the user triggers authentication
    When the library starts the authentication flow
    Then a random UUID v4 should be generated for sessionId
    And the sessionId should be stored for the session
    And the library should log "DEBUG: Generated session ID: {session_id_prefix}..."
    And the same sessionId should be used in all x-http-request-info headers
    And the sessionId should persist across all API calls until logout

  Scenario: Request ID is generated for each API call
    Given the library needs to make an API call
    When generating the x-http-request-info header
    Then the library should get current timestamp in milliseconds
    And the library should extract last 9 digits
    And the requestId should be exactly 9 digits
    And each API call should have a unique requestId
    And the library should log "DEBUG: Request ID: {request_id}"

  # ============================================================================

    And the user should not need to re-authenticate
    And the workflow should continue seamlessly

  Scenario: Workflow with reauth required
    Given the user is authenticated
    And the library has been running for 15 minutes
    When the token expires and refresh also fails
